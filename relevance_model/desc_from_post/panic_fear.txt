fear of losing control or going crazy or dying
I'm so paranoid about my heath and i will often think i am having a sudden medical emergency stroke/PE/hemorrhage/blood clot.
Extreme Death Anxiety
Don't want to end up crazy and be put in a mental hospital.
The fear that "What if I go crazy and do it?" and so on.
I'm terrified, I'm spinning out of control.
