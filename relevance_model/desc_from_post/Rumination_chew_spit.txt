Sometimes I eat, sometimes I spit. 
I keep regurgitating up my food
A lot of the time I end up chewing food and spitting it back out.
I did everything from puking, to not eating, to chewing my food and spitting it into a cup.
I have made myself throw up and I have also chewed and spit out my food.
I often burp up food if I make the mistake of bending over after I eat, and sometimes I will still regurgitate/taste food eaten 5+ hours before.
It takes what you think you know, chews it up, swallows it, and regurgitates it on you
