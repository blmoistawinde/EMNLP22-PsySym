In those days, I would still unavoidably think about the traumatic days 1 year ago and how anxiety may well come back but they are only thoughts - they never manifest themselves to anxiety felt by the body.
I have random moments of intense anxiety (some entirely random, some triggered) and then have series of intrusive thoughts, which usually just tug at my insecurities making me really believe the thoughts.
I also believed that my intrusive thoughts were demons.
With the anxiety, it takes very little to trigger me. I'm dealing really badly with intrusive thoughts, and my mind keeps heading back to unpleasant memories from a few years ago.
For example, many sufferers of classic PTSD symptoms report having troubling dreams or intense memories of the traumatic event, to the point they intrude on everyday life.
People said it would get better, it never did and every time these memories intrude and take over my mind, it's like it's happening all over again.
Ever since the incident, I have had almost constant intrusive flashbacks and memories pertaining to it accompanied with horrible guilt.
My intrusive thoughts are more like flashbacks that are seen in PTSD.
These 'flashbacks' have always given me excruciating pain, not physically, but both emotionally and mentally.
My PTSD stems for serious physical abuse at home and at school growing up so this flashback was pretty intense...
Where will I go when the choking, hallucinations, nightmares, flashbacks, paranoia, hyper arousal flood back?
