fear of traumatic events
Of all the traumatic experiences, the ones that still brings terror are memories or images triggering memories of being suffocated while beaten.  
My PTSD stems from many years of physical abuse so these nightmares get extremely intense.
These violent events are frightening.
I'm terrified of sexual abuse happening again and it's a constant fear. 
Traumatic events like that just scare me for like a week when I realize just how scary that event is.
Can traumatic experiences create an anxiety disorder? 
The horror of war destroys people's sense of human connection.
I have a great level of stress and anxiety over seeing my abuser again
it was pretty bad, intrusive thoughts of violence, ridiculously heightened startle response
I'm now afraid of things, the last traumatic event was a tornado warning in our area, I had a full blown manic episode over this, and generally it's a pain in the ass.
