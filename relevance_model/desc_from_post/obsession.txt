Why can't I calm the thoughts or read them--this low buzzing in my head that I cannot dismiss or decode?
For instance, she is really worried about contamination and keeping everything clean.
halp! my cleanliness ocd is kicking into high gear &gt;_O So I am on meds for it, and it's helping but i am washing my hands so damn much the back of my hands are starting to crack :( .
The problem I have is that, after I have cleaned myself thoroughly, I still feel like there is something there.
Hoards and hides food, dirty dishes
Constantly fear harming yourself or someone else even though you know you never would.
Obsessive need for neatness or symmetry.
My OCD revolves around perfectionism and symmetry, as well as purity.
The mainstay of my OCD has always been intrusive thoughts of hurting others and/or myself.
What if somehow I end up in a situation where I'm suicidal or homicidal?
