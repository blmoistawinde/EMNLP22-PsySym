But now it no longer matters to me. I no longer get the same joy out of it, I no longer challenge myself to draw anything new or different, I stopped collecting tutorials, and I stopped following artists and their work.
I'm generally losing interest in everything in life again, but for some reason sometimes there will be periods throughout the year where I feel excited to be ambitious, start new things, projects, work, creativity with music, etc.
My interest in worldly pleasures is declining.
Once again, my obsession has disappeared and I'm no longer interested in skateboarding.
I have not suffered from any lack of energy but I have felt myself starting to lose motivation and drive for things that used to mean everything to me. (motivation)
I lose interest in everything that I always enjoyed and I find it extremely difficult to talk to people because all I can think of is death.
Recently I've begun to lose motivation to do things, eat, or talk to people.(motivation)
I have had bad relationships because I lose interest in people (even with friends, I just get bored).
It's been a while since it started to happen to me, somehow I just stopped feeling things, enjoying things(If I ever enjoyed anything), I no longer feel alive, I just exist, but lately, it's getting harder to exist.
Working with children no longer gives me the joy that it used to.
Things that should or have in the past made me happy are no longer doing that and although I've had brief moments/days/weeks of feeling good and happy again, they never last.
I no longer have any hobbies or interests, I can no longer enjoy video games, I can't really get involved in conversations with the few online groups I've tried making friends out of, and I have no motivation to better myself as a person.
