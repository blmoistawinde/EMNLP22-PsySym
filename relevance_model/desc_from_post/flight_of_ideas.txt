Honestly, the thoughts are racing through my head so quickly, it's hard to keep up with everything.
So many thoughts clogging the way that I can not give anything my full attention let alone part of it for to long.
Like, my mind is going so many directions, and I can't get the right words out.
Thoughts occur so frequently and so fast that we cannot see them but we can feel the effect they have in the body.
I'm sorry if this seems incoherent, but it's mostly just a stream of thought.
And I can't even think straight to type all the things that have been running through my head nonstop.
My mind constantly races and I have a hard time sorting through all the thoughts.
