When my “crazy” side is more dominate, my thoughts race, I can’t focus on one thing, my energy levels are through the roof, I snap at anyone for anything.
I couldn't sleep or eat and I felt restless all the time.
I am now 21, and since high school, I always found I had difficulty concentrating on things, constant thoughts, over-analyzing every single situation, and constantly moving around, being restless and unable to sit still.
It's 4.30 am and I'm so restless I'll go insane soon, I want to just punch someone in the face right now.
I'm constantly restless and agitated.
I wake up everyday with my heart racing, feeling restless, moving my leg all day, breathless, needing to breath deeply, and i kinda obsess about it all day.
I was doing it because I was so damn happy, energetic, and restless.
I've also been teary at every little thing and have been extremely irritable and agitated.
As well as constant restlessness, agitated while sitting, and shaky hands
I alternate from not being able to calm down and being extraordinarily agitated to crying on the floor for no reason.
I get very agitated at unpredictable times over very small or sometimes even nonexistent things.
