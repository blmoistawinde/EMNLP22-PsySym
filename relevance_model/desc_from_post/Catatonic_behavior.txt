I had extreme startle responses and couldnâ€™t stand loud noises like fireworks as they made me physically flinch and jump.
Jumping at literally any noise, the sweating, tingling fingers, numb head and scalp, and derealization/depersonalization, etc.
Heightened alertness
My startle reflex is extreme. 
I have hyper-arousal, and I go into a visceral fight or flight response when I see things in the corner of my eyes, hear a loud noise, or get into an argument.
Sometimes I get the feeling that people think that I am just 'naturally' jumpy. 
I jump and nearly scream (or do) at unforeseen objects, people, and noises. 
Loud noises make me go into a state of hyper vigilance. 
On the rare occasions that I go out I'm in a state of hyper awareness and even the most innocent of sounds like a helo overhead, someone dropping something with a thud, or a noisy group of people is enough to make me lock up and tremble like a frightened child.  
You become hyper alert to all things that used to go unnoticed, but now often startle you and send you into fear and panic in an instant.
